## MQTT

### Get a MQTT Client App

Before we begin the next section, you might want another application handy—a standalone MQTT client. You could try:

  * [MQTT.fx](http://mqttfx.org/) (GUI; Windows/Mac)
  * [MQTTBox](http://workswithweb.com/mqttbox.html) (GUI; Windows/Mac/Linux)
  * mosquitto-clients from [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is available via package manager (CLI; Linux/Mac)
  * Various free clients on app stores (iOS/Android)
  * [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) can also connect to an MQTT broker (Web; Windows/Mac/Linux)

Using one isn’t strictly necessary, but will aid experimentation
